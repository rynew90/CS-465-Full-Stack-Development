# CS-465-Fullstack-Development

1. Architecture
    1. Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
'''Express HTML is used to set up the structure and layout of a webpage to organize images, links, paragraphs, headers and footers, and sidebar items. Javascript is a programming language used in the client-side development of web-based applications that implements dynamic functionality and objects that serve the user when interacting with the web page, such as user input validation. Single-page applications (SPA) are web-based applications that use one web page to display all of the data and information held in the back-end of the application, replacing existing HTML code with the code for the page being navigated to. All of these components are essential to creating a rich and efficient user experience that reduces load times for the web pages.'''
    3. Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
'''The back-end portion of the webpage used a NoSQL database in order to increase the flexibility of the data types. Using a NoSQL database, the webpage was able to create a semi-structured dataset with a schema defined by the developers.'''

2. Functionality
    1. How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
       '''JSON is different from Javascript in that it is primarily used to store data for Javascript objects. This JSON data is used to link the data from the back-end servers to the front-end user interface. It can also be used as an initial data store for database creation.'''
    2. Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
       '''One of the times that I refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency was to abstract the header and footer html code for the web pages. This allowed for much more concise and readable html code and helped to simplify the html code, allowing for reuseable code in other html files that contain code for a webpage within the application. Reuseable code allows for a more simplified code file, as well as the ability to reduce the amount of coding necessary for logic and coding that is used frequently in an application.'''

3. Testing
    1. Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
       '''The methods used in API endpoints are typically the methods involved in CRUD functions that work with databases to create, read, update, and delete data from the database. These methods are called GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. API endpoints are the locations where requests to the database or server can be made, relating to specific links or actions within the web-based application. Security involved employing user authentication and authorization, as well as encryption of sensitive data. This keeps certain functionality out of the hands of users that shouldn’t have access to the PUT, POST, and DELETE methods, keeping data secure within the application.'''

4. Reflection
    1. How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
       '''This course has been a challenging undertaking in working with a new programming language that I have not dealt with before. I have learned more about APIs, how they work, and how to create my own API to develop a full stack web application. I also learned methods of how to create front-end components that work with a data driven server-side back-end to create a secure admin page for adding, editing, and deleting data in the database. Learning these skills, and honing skills related to database management will help to make me a more competitive candidate in the software engineering field, as well as make me more marketable to potential employers.'''
